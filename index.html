            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a skilled thief who specializes in 
                stealing secrets from within the subconscious during the dream state.
                 His abilities have made him a valuable player in the world of corporate espionage 
                 but have also cost him dearly. Cobb is offered a chance at redemption when he is tasked 
                 with planting an idea in someone's mind—a process known as "inception." As he assembles 
                 a team to carry out the mission, Cobb must confront his own demons and navigate the blurred 
                 lines between reality and dreams.</p>

            <h2>Why I Love It</h2>
            <p>Inception is a cinematic marvel that combines a complex,
                 layered narrative with stunning visuals and a mesmerizing 
                 score by Hans Zimmer. Christopher Nolan's direction is masterful,
                  and the performances, particularly by Leonardo DiCaprio, are captivating.
                   The film's exploration of dreams, reality, and the subconscious is both 
                   intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant. The ambiguous ending 
                   leaves viewers questioning the nature of reality, making it a film that stays 
                   with you long after the credits roll.</p>
